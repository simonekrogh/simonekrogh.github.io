I am a fourth-year Linguistics PhD candidate working with [Liina Pylkkänen](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/liina-pylkkanen/) in the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/) at NYU. My research uses magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the brain mechanisms underlying different syntactic processes, with a specific focus on how these surface during  at-a-glance processing of multi-word stimuli (a stimulus delivery technique known as Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation). 

For my dissertation, I am working on a large-scale MEG project investigating how neural representations are shaped by their functional roles and the surrounding context during serial and parallel presentation. I have also conducted an MEG project contrasting Danish two-word sentence to investigate syntactic dependencies in a working memory-free paradigm.

Prior to joining NYU’s PhD program, I earned a Bachelor and Master of Arts in English Studies from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. While both degrees were interdisciplinary, my MA in particular offered many opportunities to engage with linguistically oriented questions, resulting in, for instance, an article examining language ideologies among long-term international students in Denmark. For my Master’s thesis, I conducted a psycholinguistic study on Danish-English bilinguals’ cognate processing in L1 and L2 tasks.
